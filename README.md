#Wearable Health Device Capstone 2013

##Intro & Goal
Codename: NANA (Nearly Autonomous Nursing Assistant)
This project is aimed at developing an automated system to tend to the needs of the elderly and sick. In todayâ€™s society, many retirement and nursing homes employ personnel, trained to provide health care for patients. However, in the modern world of technological advancement, it is only natural to imagine an automated system that would aid in the healthcare and well-being of those who cannot look after themselves. The goal of this project and hence the final product, is to aid the aging population in living a comfortable lifestyle, to monitor their health especially when no one is around to do it for them.
